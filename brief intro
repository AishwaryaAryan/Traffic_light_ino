# ESP8266 Traffic Light System ðŸš¦

## Overview  
This project simulates a *traffic light system* using an ESP8266 and three LEDs (Red, Yellow, and Green). The LEDs follow a typical traffic light sequence with adjustable delays.

## Features  
âœ… Red, Yellow, and Green LED control  
âœ… Simulates real-world traffic light behavior  
âœ… Simple and easy to implement  

## Hardware Requirements  
- *ESP8266* (NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini, etc.)  
- *LEDs* (Red, Yellow, Green)  
- *Resistors* (220Î© recommended)  
- *Breadboard & jumper wires*  

## Circuit Connections  
| LED | ESP8266 Pin |
|------|------------|
| Red  | D1 (GPIO5) |
| Yellow | D2 (GPIO4) |
| Green  | D3 (GPIO0) |

## Installation & Usage  
1. Connect the LEDs as per the circuit diagram.  
2. Upload traffic_light.ino to the ESP8266 using Arduino IDE.  
3. Observe the LED sequence simulating a real traffic light.  

## Code Explanation  
- The *Red LED* turns on for 5 seconds.  
- The *Yellow LED* turns on for 2 seconds.  
- The *Green LED* turns on for 5 seconds.  
- The cycle repeats continuously.
